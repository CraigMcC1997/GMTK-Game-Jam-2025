Day 1 (Wednesday):

Updated the UI for the upgrades page
Added player and enemy health
Gave player a gun to shoot
Changed from insta death for enemies to taking damage when shot
Added a start and end screen to clean up the game a little bit
Game now ends when their health reaches 0
Game over shows the players highest stats
Added a controls and instructions page for ease of play and to keep everything inside the game itself

Day 3 (Friday):
Major tweaks across the entire game to make it more playable and fun
A lot of bug fixing and play testing
Fixed an issue with the buttons which was due to text scaling causing the mouse to be incorrectly tracked
Moved enemies to spawn outside of the playable area
Added a laser sight to make aiming easier
Tested Linux & web builds (web build extremely slow)
Added text to the controls and instructions page
Added audio for the player, bullets and menu clicks
Uploaded my first build of the game and submitted early, was in the first 400 submissions (1 day and 23 hours early)
Made the game page on itch.io

Day 4 (Saturday):
Added scene transitions to smooth out the jarring cuts between level changes
Updates controls page with a more user friendly assets instead of text
Added Menu enemy for visual appeal
Updated the entire games visuals with Brackleys 2D asset pack
Added all audio for now, mostly finalised the game, some tweaks needed and still plenty of time left
Officially chose the name "Loop of the Dead"
Fixed audio for player death / game over
Added audio for enemy hit & enemy death
Fully integrated a pause menu into the game allowing for pause, resume, restart and main menu

Day 5 (Sunday):
Touched as little code as possible today as to not risk breaking anything
Edited the games page theme to match the game a little more
Zoomed camera out for a bigger game screen
Added a hit marker which flashes the players colour red for a few frames
Added more enemies per level as it's a game jam and they should be fun
Added a "Enemies killed" stat as it's probably the most likely
Finally added a check to stop the players health going below zero (annoyed me, but forgot about it every time)
Updated the controls page to include pause button
Updated to allow esc for exiting Menus
Uploaded the final builds (Browser, Windows & Linux) at 11:30am, playtested my game for final bugs and halted all production
