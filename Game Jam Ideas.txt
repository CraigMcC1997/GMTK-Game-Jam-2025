Game Jam Ideas:

Theme: LOOP

!! infinite enemy spawner
- as time goes on the enemies get stronger + do more damage
- round based, option to quit after each round
	- give up = keep all coins, but give up chance for more coins
	- Keep going = chance of getting more coins for completing this next round, but dying means player only gets portion of overall 
- when player dies they are presented with 3 upgrades, health | damage | speed
- then the game starts again with the new stats, player plays until death in which case game loops forever
